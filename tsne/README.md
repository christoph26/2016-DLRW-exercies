#t-SNE

##Problem 27-29
To run t-SNE on a large number of data samples, an optimized version of the algorithms is necessary. Having a runtime of O(nÂ²) the standard algorithms is to expensive for large datasets, as e.g. required for Problem 29.

"bhtsne.py" contains an implementation of the Barnes-Hut-SNE algorithm using the BH-SNE implementation and the python wrapper from "http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne". Before execution, the BH-SNE implementation must be compiled by the commando:

g++ sptree.cpp tsne.cpp -o bh_tsne -O2

The algorithms can be executed for the MNIST-dataset with the method "produce_MNIST_plot(n_samples=None, fancy_markers=False, output_name='plot.png')". It performs BH-SNE as described in the paper and saves the results in a plot.

n_samples: number of samplex, which are used in the algorithms. If the value is "None", all samples are used.
fancy_markers: Flag that specifies the design of the result plot. If the flag is false, a colourfull scatterplot is produced. If it is true, a plot with the imput data as markers analogous to figure 5 of the paper is produced.
output_name: File name of the result plot
